# Scala Playground
I use this workspace / environment to learn and test new Scala concepts.

## Motivation
I have created this repository to share my Scala code as I uncover new concepts and strategies. This will allow me to refer back to my code in the future and also share snippets with my colleagues.

## Goals
In the near future I will be writing very short blog posts on my [blog](https://nerminsehic.me). I plan to link to sections in this repository.

## Contribution
If you stumble across any code that is incorrect or could be improved, you are more than welcome to raise an issue here. I don't have any hard requirements for issues, as long as your clearly explain what the problem is or how it could be improved. Raising an issue will help me improve my craft.
